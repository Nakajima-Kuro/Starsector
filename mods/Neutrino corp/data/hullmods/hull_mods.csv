Neutrino Sigma Upgrade,neutrino_sigmaupgrade,,,Neutrino,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.NeutrinoSigmaUpgrade,"A set of proprietary combat systems including
 - A sturdy onmi shield with a narrow arc (around %s degrees).
 - An A.I. enhanced targeting system that boosts both weapon auto fire accuracy and missile tracking performance.
 - A slightly more durable weapon emplacement design that increases all weapons' durability by %s percent.

In additional, the ship's flux core is fine tuned for a higher dissipation rate at the expense of max capacity and active flux vent rate (vent rate reduced to %s percent), these changes will extend to all extra flux vents and capacitors as well.

WARNING, Incompatible with Extended Shields, Front Shield Emitter, and Front Shield Generator. Overriding the safety protocols may leads to critical malfunction.",,graphics/neut/hullmods/neutrino_sigma.png
Neutrino Autonomous Drone,neutrino_drone,,,Neutrino,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.NeutrinoDrone,"Although it will still need someone to maintain it, this advanced AI drone is fully autonomous in battle so no crew will be lost if it is destroyed.",,graphics/neut/hullmods/neutrino_sigma.png
Neutrino Omega Upgrade,neutrino_omegaupgrade,3,,Neutrino,"offensive, defensive","Weapons, Defenses",10000,,,,6,10,15,20,data.hullmods.NeutrinoOmegaUpgrade,"A high-end upgrade reserved for Neutrino operatives and corporate interests. Design for ships that been deployed to decisive battles. Advance target analysis system increase %s damage done to capital ships or stations,  and %s damage done to cruisers. Also increases armor by %s/%s/%s/%s depend on hull size.",Increases armor rating. Increase damage done to large target.,graphics/neut/hullmods/neutrino_omega.png
Neutronium Plating,neutrino_neutroniumplating,,,Neutrino,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.NeutrinoNeutroniumPlating,"With a patented plating technique, an ultrathin neutronium plating can be applied on all neutrino ships, which offers a %s percent increase to armor strength and reduces damage done to the armor by %s.

Special field generators maintain both the liquidity and integrity of these neutronium plating, while active it makes the whole plating serve as a single armor block equal to %s armor HP for this ship. Reducing damage taken by weapons and engines by %s , hull damage is reduced by %s, and EMP damage is reduced by %s too.

Plating strength will start to regenerate if no damage is dealt to the hull in %s seconds, and will restore to full strength in %s seconds.
Once the plating takes too much damage or the ship's flux systems overload, the neutronium plating will collapse and need to recharge to at least %s of max strength to reboot.

Due to the flux disturbance, plating only provide %s resistance while venting.",,graphics/neut/hullmods/neutrino_powerarmor.png
High Torque Turret Motor,neutrino_hightarqueturretmotor,3,,Neutrino,offensive,Weapons,10000,,,,4,6,8,10,data.hullmods.NeutrinoHighTarqueTurretMotor,"Replace all turret motors in weapon slots with high torque models to optimize their performance with heavy turrets. Increases all weapon turn rate by %s degrees per second. In addition, all energy and ballistic weapon recoil is reduced by %s, and range increase by %s.",Slightly increase weapon range and turning speed.,graphics/neut/hullmods/neutrino_turrettorque.png
Autonomous Sensor Drone,neutrino_sensorDrone,,,Neutrino,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.NeutrinoSensorDrone,These fully autonomous sensor drones are equipped with advanced miniaturized high resolution sensors that can provide %s sensor strength.,,graphics/hullmods/high_res_sensors.png
Neutrino Tau Upgrade,neutrino_broadsideShield,2,,Neutrino,defensive,"Shields, Engines",6000,,,,5,10,15,15,data.hullmods.NeutrinoBroadsideShield,"An assault refitting set for close range assault. Increase shield arc to %s, but lock the shield into front facing position and increase %s damage taken by shield. Optimized engine management increase max speed by %s and increase zero flux speed boost by %s. But increased engine output will interferes sensors and reduce %s weapon range. Neutrino ships only.",Increase shield coverage and ship max speed at cost of shield efficiency and weapon range.,graphics/neut/hullmods/neutrino_broadsideShield.png
Target Data Link,neutrino_fighterTargetingLink,,,Neutrino,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.NeutrinoFighterTargetingLink,A data link system that can fetch targeting data from mothership.,,graphics/neut/hullmods/neutrino_sigma.png
