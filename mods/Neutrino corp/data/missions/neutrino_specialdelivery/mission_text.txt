It seems independent forces have located and tracked us, probably with some help from the Tri-Tachyons. Two Conquest-class ships and an assortment of smaller ships don't seem to want us to leave.

Unfortunately for Tri-Tachyon, the possibilty of their success in slowing our prototypes transfer is slim, despite the advantage of surprise they have attained. Eliminate all approaching hostiles.
