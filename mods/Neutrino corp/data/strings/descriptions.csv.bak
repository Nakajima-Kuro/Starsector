neutrino_neutronlance,WEAPON,"The Tachyon Lance's predecessor, it is still in many ways superior. High energy use and difficulty mounting makes it being rarely used outside of capital ships.

Unlike the unpredictable tachyon beam, the neutron beam can reliably overload shields and break though armor more effectively. However, the lethal radiation released while firing requires an energy-intensive active shield to be integrated into the weapon system.

""Initiate an antimatter-catalyzed fusion reaction in a proprietary neutron reflect chamber that results in a burst neutron beam."" That's the words came from Neutrino's instruction manual. And people believe that ""proprietary neutron reflect chamber"" is a reason of conflict between Neutrino and Tri-Tachyon.

neutrino_photontorpedo,WEAPON,"A battery of unique torpedoes that deliver modest damage warheads in quick succession Requires charging of munitions with energy before firing.

Photon torpedo can reload in combat easily and safely due to the inertness of the uncharged torpedoes. That make this hybrid weapon more like a energy blaster in missile slot. It can provide sustained strike power in a prolonged fight. But it cost energy to fire, lack of range(compare to other missiles) and interceptable.

The Mark IV series Photon torpedoes are much differ from its predecessor. They use activated degenerating matter munition instead of pre-changed fusion shape charge. This modification significantly reduced munitions' energy/damage radio by costing some effective range. And they still compatible to the former launchers.

Although it is designed for point defense, Magnetar also often be used to keep up pressure on shield. Especially on some compact ship designs.

One of the final models come from the ""Salvo"" project, a set of new point defense weapon designs to counter the intensified missile saturation attack. Due to its accuracy just merely reach PD standard, Magnetar was an underdog in this project until its potential usage as an assault weapon was discovered. Instead of mend its inaccuracy, the engineers decided to further improve its firing rate. So in practice, Magnetar can be used to replace some other shield pressuring assault weapons and that result more PD can be used when facing saturation attacks.

As a compacted energy weapon for the ship of the line of battle, Neutron Pulse Cannon was born for long range bombardment.

As a partial success prototype to proof the practicability of Neutron Cannon miniaturization, the Model 17, which was named as ""Light Neutron Pulse Cannon"" later, had reached most expected goals, except its active neutron shield was a little less efficiency. Although the size fit, the Model 17 could not be used on modularized small energy weapon slot since the intensive energy consumptive when firing had exceeded the limit of technical standard.
