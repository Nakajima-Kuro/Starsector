Minor Printing Defects,IndEvo_print_low,,,,dmod,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.hullmods.IndEvo_PrintDefectsLow,"This hull shows some signs of automated construction - Connectors fused to sockets, small metal fragments jutting out of walls due to scanning errors and other minor, but annoying problems.

Reduces the repair rate by %s, increases CR degradation after peak performance time by %s, and has a small chance to experience %s in combat.",,graphics/hullmods/printing_defects.png
Printing Defects,IndEvo_print_med,,,,dmod,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.hullmods.IndEvo_PrintDefectsMed,"This hull has the telltale signs of automated construction - Steel plates where there should not be any, doors welded to their frames, metal beams crossing through corridors and constant minor issues plague this ship.

Reduces the repair rate by %s, increases upkeep by %s, increases CR degradation after peak performance time by %s, and has a chance to experience %s in combat.",,graphics/hullmods/printing_defects.png
Major Printing Defects,IndEvo_print_high,,,,dmod,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.hullmods.IndEvo_PrintDefectsHigh,"This hull bears heavy marks of automated construction - Faulty bulkheads, leaking atmosphere and entire inaccessible sections due to scanning and construction errors. It is a prime example of why this technology was not established before the collapse.

Reduces the repair rate by %s, increases upkeep by %s, slows turret turn rate by %s, increases CR degradation after peak performance time by %s, and has a high chance to experience %s in combat.",,graphics/hullmods/printing_defects.png
Automated Construction,IndEvo_auto,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.hullmods.IndEvo_PrintingHullMod,"This hull was created entirely via automated means. No amount of work will ever completely remove the traces of this, even if they are no longer impeding.",,graphics/hullmods/automated_construction.png
