sw_fusionbeam,WEAPON,"A deadly beam weapon capable of dealing huge amount of damage without any regards to power consumption or installation cost, ideal for ships with limited weapon slots.",,,
sw_plasmastorm,WEAPON,"A terrifying weapon rarely seen anywhere, the PS-299x (Or Plasma Storm) swarms the battlefield with volatile heat seeking Plasma charges, each capable of changing target mid-flight, deals high damage but requires huge amount of energy to fire.",,,
sw_phalanx,WEAPON,"The Phalanx launches a pair of Supercharged Particles that deals massive areal damage on impact, the sheer power of this weapon can easily overload most targets and destroy all fighters and missiles around them.",,,
sw_tartarus,WEAPON,"Advancements in EM-missile design enables the Tartarus to surpass its predecessor with improved damage and tracking range, contact with targets delivers more potent EMP blasts allowing this weapon to disable most capital ships from long distances.",,,
sw_photonlense,WEAPON,"This unique weapon concentrates light into dense matter and launches it at high speed, impact destabilizes the target reducing its resistance to kinetic damage, particularly effective against shields.",,,
sw_terror,WEAPON,"This battery launches 8 unguided terror torpedoes in quick succession ripping apart unshielded targets in no-time, overwhelms most PD weapons, optimal for mid range encounters.",,,
sw_railgun,WEAPON,"An unconventional weapon that accelerates energy into supersonic stream via electromagnetic circuits, the stream will bypass everything until it reaches maximum distance, highly effective against larger ships.",,,
sw_clustertorpedo,WEAPON,"The XC-T61 is a modified version of whats originally considered an orbital weapon, upon impact it deals heavy damage and then splinters into multiple cluster mines that detonates in rapid succession dealing massive damage to all objects within a wide area around them, ships caught within the detonation area will be left either disabled, overloaded or destroyed due to the massive damage they take.",,,
sw_gauss,WEAPON,"This long range weapon fires highly pressurized slugs that build up Kinetic energy as they travel further, damage scales with distances to targets allowing this weapon to outperform it's counterparts at maximum range at the cost of close quarters efficiency.",,,
sw_devastator,WEAPON,"This powerful weapon fires a burst of concentrated EM energy capable of disrupting the systems of unshielded targets, it deals heavy damage but requires long time to recharge making it inefficient in prolonged engagements.",,,
sw_prismdriver,WEAPON,"A high pressure burst laser capable of dealing massive damage to a group of enemies, it's devastating impact results in an energy discharge that damages additional targets based on proximity.",,,
sw_reflective_shield,WEAPON,"This Unique module takes up a heavy slot in exchange of modifying the ship shields allowing them to Reflect most incoming projectiles, while incapable of inflicting any real damage on it's own, the WM-70 scales it's effectivness based on the offensive capabilities of hostile ships.",,,
sw_positronlens,WEAPON,"The Positron lens is a modified version of the Photon driver created by the Syndicate, it sacrifices some of its support capabilities in exchange of improved damage output, the impact Ionizes the target causing it to take increased damage from most sources.",,,
sw_blackhole,WEAPON,"The GR-890 concentrates dense Antimatter into pure energy that destabilizes spacetime, after few seconds of uninterrupted firing the target area Implodes creating a miniature Black Hole that rapidly damages all nearby objects within a wide area around itself, Weapon requires lots of time and energy to fire.",,,
sw_bfg,WEAPON,"A terrifying Radioactive weapon that crushes all in it's path, while slow, the Protonium charge can damage targets far away from it's location making this weapon ideal against both larger ships and swarm of smaller crafts, requires lots of energy to fire.",,,
sw_lightspear,WEAPON,"This weapon fires an Ionized Plasma charge that shatters violently on hit, resulting splinters ravages everything in their path and can damage multiple targets in a straight line.",,,
sw_hyperpulse,WEAPON,"Rapid firing pulse emitter designed to repel attackers at medium ranges, it offers high damage, good range and great accuracy allowing it to excel in any combat scenario.",,,
sw_flash,WEAPON,"This powerful anti-matter Accelerator launches a piercing Tachyon-charge that ravages everything in its path, the charge is highly effective against all types of defense and it's damage grows greater the further it travels.",,,
